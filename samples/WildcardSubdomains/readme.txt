# Fu# recognize all hosts (it defaults to localhost for security reasons)
#
# To enable wildcard subdomain, however, will also require that you have
# proper DNS lookup setup as well which can be worked around locally
# by pasting the content of this file to your machine's hosts file
# typically at C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
#
# Then start the project and try http://x.localhost/ and http://y.localhost/
